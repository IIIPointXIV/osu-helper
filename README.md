# How To Use
1. Download exe from latest [release](https://github.com/IIIPointXIV/osu-helper/releases).
2. Move exe to easy to remember folder (Like the desktop.)
3. Run it.
4. Check that the path shown is the correct path. If it is not correct, click the "osu! Path" button select the correct path.
5. If you don't see any skins, click "Find Skins".
6. In osu, press "ctrl + alt + shift + s" to reload skins.
7. Switch to the "!!!osu!helper Skin"
8. Every time you change skins or options in osu!helper, press "ctrl + alt + shift + s" to reload the skin.

# Limitations
 - Due to how osu works, it is not able to change skins mid-song.
 - Due to difference in build, it will not work with osu!lazer (beg [ppy](https://twitter.com/ppy) to put these options into lazer)
 - "ctrl + alt + shift + s" or restarting osu must happen to change skins
